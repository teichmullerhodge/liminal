A simple project using raylib. 

With the arrow keys you move the figure.

N freezes the current figure and create a new one.
B deletes the current figure and go back to the previous one.
C changes the figure to a random color.
K changes the figure shape, current there is circle, square and rectangle.
Q quits the application.

Numpad 5 increases the size of the figure.
Numpad 2 reduces the size of the figure.

Have fun.
